# Copilot Instructions for Chortle

## Project Overview

Chortle is a family chore chart application designed to help families manage household tasks through gamification, progress tracking, and reward systems. The app targets families with children aged 5-18 and aims to make chore management engaging and motivating.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: [VanJS](https://vanjs.org/) - A lightweight reactive UI framework
- **Styling**: [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/) - Minimal CSS framework for clean styling
- **Architecture**: Static files only - no build step required
- **Deployment**: Static file hosting (works with any static hosting service)
- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+ modules)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Conventions

1. **JavaScript**:
   - Use ES6+ features and modules
   - Import VanJS from CDN: `import van from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vanjs-org/van/public/van-1.5.5.min.js"`
   - Use VanJS reactive patterns for state management
   - Follow functional programming patterns where possible
   - Use const/let appropriately, avoid var

2. **HTML**:
   - Keep index.html minimal - main content should be generated by VanJS
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements
   - Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Mobile-first responsive design

3. **CSS**:
   - Water.css provides base styles - add custom styles in main.css only when needed
   - Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
   - Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
   - Keep styles minimal and clean

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Component-Based**: Use VanJS's component pattern for reusable UI elements
2. **State Management**: Leverage VanJS's reactive state for application state
3. **Static First**: No backend required - use localStorage/IndexedDB for persistence
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works without JavaScript

### Key Features to Implement

Based on REQUIREMENTS.md, focus on these core features:

1. **Task Management**:
   - Create, assign, and schedule chores
   - Support for one-time and recurring tasks
   - Difficulty levels and point values

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Visual dashboards for completion status
   - Streak tracking and completion history
   - Photo evidence upload capability

3. **Reward System**:
   - Point-based rewards and badges
   - Milestone celebrations
   - Redemption interface

4. **User Roles**:
   - Parent/Guardian (admin capabilities)
   - Child/Family Member (task execution)
   - Different UI views based on role

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   npx http-server -o -c-1 -s
   ```

2. **No Build Process**: Direct file editing and browser refresh

3. **Testing**: Manual testing in browser, focus on:
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Offline functionality (if implemented)

### Constraints and Considerations

1. **Child Safety**: 
   - COPPA compliance for users under 13
   - Age-appropriate UI design
   - Parental controls and oversight

2. **Performance**:
   - Target 2-second response times
   - Optimize for mobile devices
   - Minimal JavaScript bundle size

3. **Accessibility**:
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation support

### Common Tasks

When working on Chortle, you'll often need to:

1. **Add New Components**: Create VanJS components following the reactive pattern
2. **State Management**: Use VanJS state objects for reactive data
3. **Styling**: Extend Water.css with minimal custom CSS
4. **Data Persistence**: Implement localStorage/IndexedDB solutions
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-first approach

### Example Code Patterns

```javascript
// VanJS Component Pattern
const TaskCard = (task) => {
  const completed = van.state(task.completed)
  
  return div({class: "task-card"},
    h3(task.title),
    p(task.description),
    button({
      onclick: () => completed.val = !completed.val
    }, () => completed.val ? "✓ Completed" : "Mark Complete")
  )
}

// State Management
const appState = {
  tasks: van.state([]),
  currentUser: van.state(null),
  rewards: van.state([])
}
```

### Testing Approach

- Manual testing across different devices and browsers
- Focus on user experience for different age groups
- Test parent and child user flows separately
- Validate accessibility features
